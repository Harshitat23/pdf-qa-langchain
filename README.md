# 📄 PDF-Powered QA System using Embeddings + LangChain

A Question-Answering (QA) system that allows you to upload any PDF document and then ask natural language questions about its content.
Built with LangChain, embeddings, and vector stores to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

🚀 Features

Upload any PDF and parse its content

Generate embeddings for chunks of the PDF

Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval
 
Ask questions in natural language and get precise answers

Powered by LangChain for document retrieval and LLM integration

Simple and modular codebase for easy customization

🏗️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

LangChain

FAISS / Chroma (Vector Store)

OpenAI or HuggingFace LLMs

PyPDF2 / pdfplumber for PDF text extraction

📖 How It Works

Extract PDF text → Split into smaller chunks

Generate embeddings → Store in vector database

Ask question → LangChain retrieves relevant chunks

LLM answers → Combines retrieved chunks into a response
